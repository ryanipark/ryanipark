## Current Project

   **[Auto Parts webstore](https://github.com/467Group3A/rimjobs) - In development as we speak, I will post example usage and screenshots as we continue.** 

**About the project:**   I am working in a team of four people to create a Auto Parts web store that uses technologies we have not been exposed to before. We have chosen the following tools in attempt to set some clear opportunities for learning.

**Project specifications:**  
- The store must utilize a read only legacy database and understand that the contents of it might change at any moment. (This DB holds the parts the site sells)
- We must build the website with the intentions of real world usage, meaning all aspects should be tested and innovated in a way that is optimal.
- We must build the website around our use case model [Model](https://i.imgur.com/xJbQcMv.png)
   
 **Tools:** 

 - Linux server to host the website
 - Node.js , express.js, and vue.js
 - MariaDB as a legacy database which holds a dynamic list of parts (This DB is read only)
 - SQLite3 as a local database which holds order information, shipping and handling charges, and employee information
 - The site implements a third parts credit card authorization system which is viewed here [(CC auth)](https://blitz.cs.niu.edu/Monitor/#/credits) 
 - Python is used to dynamically pull and populate inventory from the legacy DB. 

**My implementations:**  
*This technology is very new to me, so my focus has been all over the place as I attempt to learn as much as possible.*
 - Created an endpoint that allows for the 3rd party CC authorization to work
	 - Simple front end form in place to insure the response from the 3rd party auth is able to be displayed to the user
 - Created an interface that allows an employee to list all orders
	 - Allows to search by order status, total price range, and ID
 - Created an interface for employees that allows them to see each Order's information
	 - An employee is able to update an order status, once an order is filled they can print an invoice
 - Created a fulfillment interface for employees receiving inventory
	 - Employees are able to add to the sites inventory by part ID and amount
	 - They are also able to remove inventory from the site
 - Created an inventory endpoint that combines the part information from the legacy DB with inventory on hand from local DB.
      - This combined with our python scripts allows for parts from the legacy DB to be dynamically pulled.

## Projects
**E-Commerce web store (2022):**

**Description:** Worked in a team of five people to create a web store that interacts with a database. The website keeps track of a userâ€™s personal information, orders, and product inventory. While it is relatively minimalistic, it is a fully functioning website that would allow users to browse, purchase, and receive products. It also includes and employee/owner control panel.

**Tools:** 

 - GitHub as a version control platform
 - MariaDB as a DBMS
 - PHP, CSS, SQL, HTML

**My focus:**  

 - Creating SQL scripts that clear or fill the database with info
 - Creating and optimizing safe SQL queries
 - Displaying products and their details to the consumer

**Small demonstration of the site:**
